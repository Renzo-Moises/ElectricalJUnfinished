Introduction: What is your site about? What is the essential story it tells?
<br><br>
My website is a prototype of an independent political website focused in the spanish politics.
<br>It tells the lates and most significant news regards the spanish goverment and the opossition. It also brings the latest polls to the users.
<br><br>
Background: Who are your audience? Are there relevant stakeholders? Give (at least) 3 examples that inspired you when creating your website. These could be
websites, guest speakers, artists, books, etc.
<br><br>
Anyone who has at least a bit of curiosity on who is ruling Spain and how they are doing. It may attract independent newspaper or online media, specially the ones fighting the fake news such as "todobulo.es" or a similar one as on of the principle of the website is not to distort information.
<br>
Examples that inspired me when creating my website are my friends, we reciently have talked a lot about politics, something we were not used to do, I guess for the politics crisis Spain just had between 2018 and Dic 2019 as there were not clear mayority in congress. Another thing tht inspired me the website "newtral.es" they fight against all the roumors spread in the internet, they are extremaly good at that.
<br>
Another thing that inspired me to create a politics website was the joy to finally see a progressist goverment in power.
<br><br>
Planning: What type of structure did you choose to implement?
<br><br>
I created a html file for each page, in addition to that I have also created an internal css file to control the design of all my html files and I also added an js file to write bits of code to apply to the website.
<br>
I made sure to use a large enough font sizes in all my pages so people without a perfect view can easily see eveything.
<br>
I also tagged images with a name in case the images don't load up.
<br>
Another thing I did is I sticked to the same colour for most of the website so it wouldn't be a challenge to see clearly for daltonic people and not to confuse them.
<br>
First thing I beared in mind in terms of usuability was the navegation bar I included this bar in all the pages and in the same place so people can always go  to the pages they want instead of having to look for a link to go the wanted page.
<br>
I also implemented an "read more" button so people don't get too much information just when they open the page.
<br>
I also linked the heading of the website "Daily left" to homepage, so it's easier for someone who is not used to use the internet to control the website.
<br><br>
Implementation: State 3 things that you had to learn or research when creating the website. How did you find them out? From where? Did you take the examples directly, or did you modify them?
<br><br>
I had to learn how to set validation rules in order to use it form my contact form, it was not hard to learn, I simply watched 2 videos on youtube.
<br>
Another thing I had to learn was to implement "read more" buttons, I found this a bit harder to learn but I achieved it. I also used youtube to learn this, in this case I had to watch more than 2 videos.
<br>
I also learned how to manipulate the active link, I only knew how to manipulate the navegation bar, this was pretty easy I think it only took me around 3 minutes to know how to access it and manipulate it. In this case i didn't use youtube I went to w3schools.com which is a really recomendable resource.
<br>
I obviously modified the examples as I had to adjust it to my website and not my website adjusting to them. I have to say by watching examples about one specific thing I ended up taken a few ideas relative to other things.
<br><br>
Evaluation: State 3 things that you think worked particularly well in your work. State 3 things that you think might be improved. How would you do them differently
another time? How would you fix them given more time now?
<br><br>
In my opinion all the links I implemented worked quite good, at the first time without the need of having to spend much time on them and still each of them does its respective work.
<br>"Read more" button, I think this feature really worked out as it makes the website more intereactive and more proportional the collum paragraphs.
<br>Another thing that worked out was the data validation rules I implemented each of them worked and avoids missunderstanding in the contact form
