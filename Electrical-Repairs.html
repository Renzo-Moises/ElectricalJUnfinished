            PSOE (center-left) and Podemos (left) parties make history with their agreement to form a coalition goverment. After failing to reach an agreenment in the last legislation, even though each party had more seats than now, the leaders of PSOE and Podemos signed the nanana document which consits in 10 main points to focus once they get the mayority in congress. 
            <br><br>
            It just took 2 days after the elections for them to reach an agreement, something they couldn't do in the last legislation, even though they had a few more seats in congrss than currently. It's clear they had been discussing the terms of the agreement before the elections.
            <br><br>
            See the link below to check the full document presented by both parties!
