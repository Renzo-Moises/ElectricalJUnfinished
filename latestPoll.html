            <br>
            PSOE: Center-left party would suffer a significant loss of votes but remains as the most voted party in Spain, after the historic coallition deal between PSOE and Podemos and the contraversial agreement with ERC (Independentist) party to sort out the the Catalonia crisis the polls show a loss of votes for PSOE and their number of seats in the congress is reduced from 120 to 112.
            <br>
            Podemos: Left party Podemos would be in an ascendent route, after reaching an agreement with PSOE, something they failed to do in the last legislation and caused a significant lose of votes, the latest poll shows a small gain of votes for Podemos which is expected to result a win of 4 seats, going from 35 to 39. 
            <br>
            Mas pais: The ecologic left party isn't connecting with people as it was expected in this case they are expected to lose a seat and go from 3 to 2 seats.
            <br> 
            ERC: The independist left party is expected to get same votes as last time, 13. It seems there won't be consequences for their agreement with PSOE.
            <br>
            BNG: The galicias left party sourprisingly entered to congress in the last election with seat. It's expeceted the repeat the same result.
            <br>
            EH Bildu: Basque left party as the other regionalist left parties is expectes to repeat their result, 5 seats in this case. They will keep the right to have a parlamentary group.

            <h2 class = "pageSubheadings">Right Parties</h2>
            <p class = "Paragraph">
            <br>
            PP: Center-right party would suffer a  loss of votes but remains as the leader of the right in Spain, polls show a loss of votes for PP and their number of seats in the congress is reduced from 87 to 81. They may start looking more to the center, abandoned, than to the far right.
            <br>
            Vox: Far-right party would gain a significant amount of votes, they are still behind PP but they remain the 3rd most voted party. Votes would result a win of 9 seats, going from 52 to 61. It seems their sexist and racist message is having an effect on people.
            <br>
            Ciudadanos: Adopting an anti left parties position didn't work out in the last election as they only got 10 seats suffering a 47 seats loss. Polls show their seats won't change they keep their 10 seats.
            <br>  
            JxCat: The independist right party is expected to get a small gain of votes which would increase their seats from 7 to 10. However it doesn't look like they will suppor neither PP or Vox. Nor PSOE.
            <br>
            Nav ++: A coallition of navarrian party and PP party is expected to repeat their result, 2 seats.
            <br>
            CpM: Same as Nav ++ the coallition of melillan party and PP are expected to repeat their result, 1 seat.
